# live-wttr

## How to use
You'll need a Python module called geocoder `pip install geocoder`.

Place `live_wttr.py` under your `~/.config/qtile` directory and import `from live_wttr import LiveWttr`.
It works the same way as the original widget, but location parameter is omitted.

Every time you want to update location restart Qtile.
